Higher-Order Components

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

- const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
